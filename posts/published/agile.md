* Agile is not daily standups
* Agile is not working in sprints
* Agile is not working with stories
* Agile is not using Pivotal
* nor Trello, nor JIRa
* Agile is not SCRUM
* Agile is not doing more work with fewer people (9 women can't make a baby in one month)
* Agile is not doing retrospectives
* Agile is not planning
* Agile is not using storyboards
* Agile is not counting velocity
* Agile is not burndown graphs

Agile is getting feedback from client, constantly.

**Being agile is being able to quickly adapt to client's feedback**

What really matters is the direct contact with the client and getting feedback from person/users who will really use your code to make their life easier.

Most of the big companies forget about that, they have Managers, Product Managers, Sales Managers which stands on the line between developer and the client. I'm not saying those positions are useless but they should be a support not an obstacle making noise on the communication channel.

* You can advice your client as you have experience
* You can propose solutions as you saw and developed so many of them
* You can discuss about client's feedback

**But you cannot forget to get the feedback.**
